      During a no-pass time, the kiosk says <strong>No passes right now</strong> and when passes open. A student who
      taps their name anyway can join the line, and goes first when passes open. (Turn on
      <strong>Let students line up</strong> on the Pass Options page for this. Without it, they’re asked to wait.)

      If a student really needs to go, they can tap <strong>Ask my teacher</strong>, and you approve or deny the request
      on Home. Or tap <strong>Teacher PIN</strong> and enter your PIN right at the kiosk. Either way, their pass is marked
      so your records stay complete. (When the kiosk is this computer, or it’s offline, only the PIN works.)
